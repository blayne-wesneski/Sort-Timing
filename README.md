# Sort Timing

This project benchmarks the performance of various sorting algorithms. It includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort


It runs these algorithms against randomly generated arrays from starting at 10 elements and up to 190,000 elements. The same arrays are copied 5 times to allow all sorts to be run on the exact same data set.
These are stored within 2D arrays and the final results are stored within a 3D array.

## Output

The program will print the timing results of each sorting algorithm to the console once complete and save the results to a file named `results.csv`.
